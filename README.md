**Data-Driven Businesses with SQL**

**1.	Project Objectives & Overview**

**1.1	Business Problem** 

Eniac is an online marketplace specialising in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded 10 years ago in Spain, and it has since grown and expanded. Since the company went public, the investors have been pushing the company to scale up the business and become a big e-commerce player globally. 

Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Data shows that Brazil has an eCommerce revenue like that of Spain and Italy: an already huge market with an even bigger potential for growth. The problem for Eniac is the lack of knowledge of such a market. The company doesn’t have ties with local providers, package delivery services, or customer service agencies. Creating these ties and knowing the market would take a lot of time, while the board of directors has demanded the expansion to happen within the next year.

Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralised order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. Magist is already a big player and allows small companies to benefit from its economies of scale.

In Brazil, Eniac is considering signing a 3-year contract with Magist and operating through external marketplaces as an intermediate step, while it tests the market, creates brand awareness, and explores the option of opening its own Brazilian marketplace.

The economic conditions of the deal are already being discussed. But not everyone in the company is happy moving on with this. There are two main concerns:
1.	Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products, and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for these high-end tech products.
2.	Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?

Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. The data might have the answer to these concerns. Working as a Data Analyst to explore the Magist’s database and make recommendations about the 3-year contract.
